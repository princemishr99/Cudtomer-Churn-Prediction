# Cudtomer-Churn-Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a customer will **churn (leave the company)** or not, using their demographic and account information. Churn prediction helps businesses retain customers.

## ðŸ§  Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Label encoding for categorical variables
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Bank Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction)
- File used: `Churn_Modelling.csv`

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Steps
1. Load and explore data
2. Select relevant features (like CreditScore, Tenure, Age, Balance, etc.)
3. Encode categorical features like Gender, Geography
4. Split data and train model
5. Evaluate using accuracy and confusion matrix
6. Optional: Streamlit interface to predict churn

## ðŸ§ª Output Example
Given a customer's information, the model predicts whether they are likely to churn or stay.
